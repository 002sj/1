# This was mostly a university and personal project and will no longer be updated

TradeBot is a cryptocurrency trading bot that uses the Binance API, and a strategy based on a couple of 5 minute chart
indicators

- (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands)

### How?

- The bot uses 5 different indicators: DBB, EMA, MACD, RSI, SMA. The three main indicators will fire off a buy signal
  when a certain state has been achieved.
- When the bot has collected enough signals, an order will be placed on the market.
- Vice versa, if enough sell signals are signals are fired, a sell order will be placed.

The config for the bot can be changed using the `config.txt` file

# Modes

### Live

- **This is not a financial service or investment advice!**

  - **The default config and strategy implemented in the source code of the project serve as an example and are
    open-source.**

  - **While we intend to contribute to make the bot work well out-of-the-box, we make no specific claims about the
    profitability of it in the current market climate!**

- **Backtest your config and make sure you are ready to use this mode at your own risk!**

- This mode trades with real money on the Binance platform

- API key and Secret key required

- You can choose to add your credentials to the `credentials.txt` file for easier use

- Currently only supports market orders, this will cause a slight efficiency loss.

### Simulation

- Real-time trading simulation based on actual market data

- Trades are only simulated based on market prices

- No actual orders are made

### Backtesting

- Simulation based on historical data

- Allows for quick testing of the behavior and profitability of the bot

- Data needs to be loaded from a `.dat` file created with the `Collection` mode

### Collection

- Collects raw market price data (aggregated trades) from a specified time period

- Collected data is saved in a file in the `backtesting` directory

- Collected data can be exported to a `.csv` format

- Never run more than one TradeBot with this mode at the same time, you will likely hit the API request limit.
